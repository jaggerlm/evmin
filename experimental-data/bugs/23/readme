From default presentation example from http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js 

Doscription:
step back from the first vertical slide (#/2), using 'navigatePrev' (e.g. pageUp),
Then step forward ('navigateNext', e.g. pageDown).

Result: This steps to the second vertical slide (#/2/1).
Expect: When going back to the first slide, the correct order is restored.
